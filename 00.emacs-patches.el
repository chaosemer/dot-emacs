;;; init/00.emacs-patches.el --- Patches for buggy/old emacs code  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file serves two purposes:
;;
;; 1. It contains bugfixes for core Emacs functions.
;; 2. It backports new Emacs functionality to earlier versions that
;; are not yet available on Debian stable.
;;
;; Currently tested against:
;; * GNU Emacs 29.4
;; * GNU Emacs 30.1
;; * GNU Emacs 30.2

;;; Declarations:
